            <h2>Description:</h2>
                <p>Done correctly, a classic tiramisù can be transcendent. A creamy dessert of espresso-soaked 
                    ladyfingers surrounded by lightly sweetened whipped cream and a rich mascarpone, tiramisù 
                    relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients. If you don’t have a barista setup at home, 
                    pick up the espresso at a local coffee shop, or use strongly brewed coffee. As for the 
                    ladyfingers, make your own or buy them, but keep in mind that store-bought varieties can range 
                    from soft and spongy (like angel food cake) to hard and crunchy (like biscotti). Both kinds will 
                    work here, but if you're using the softer variety, stick to a light brushing of espresso, instead
                    of a deep dip.</p>

            <h2>Preparation:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams 
                        sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall 
                        from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to 
                        a large bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates 
                        soft-medium peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable
                         mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks 
                         until combined.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch 
                        round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they 
                        are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded 
                        side up at the bottom of the baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got 
                        an even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps (a little 
                        space in between is O.K.). Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even 
                        layer. Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Top with shaved or finely grated 
                        chocolate, if desired.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if you can 
                        wait 24 hours, all the better) before slicing or scooping to serve.</p></li>
